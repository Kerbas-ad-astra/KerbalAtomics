- Fix bundled B9PartSwitch
- Update bundled MM version
- Update bundled CRP version 
- Fix switchable tank mass and cost issues
- Fixed SXT hydrogen NTR patch typo

v0.2.0
------
- KSP 1.1 repack
- Updated CRP version
- Updated bundled MM version
- Deprecated IFS in favour of B9PartSwitch
- Added part search tags for parts
- In basic mode, trimodal NTRs no longer generate power when firing
- Fixed missing AFTER tag in LiquidFuel extra patch

0.1.2
-----
- Reduced power generation of trimodal engines
- Tweaked descriptions for some engines
- Patched LV-N now uses ModuleEnginesFX, new FX
- Added optional patch to unlock fancier NTR functionality with NF Electrical:
-- Engines have integrated reactors, reactors must heat up to nominal temperature in order to produce good thrust and Isp
-- Engines act as core heat radiators, cooling the core as a function of thrust fraction. Full thrust will cool the core completely. Without thrust or lots of radiators the core will overheat
-- Reactors will run out of fuel eventually; use much more fuel than long-term power reactors
-- Trimodal reactors have a generator component that takes priority over the engine. It will use a small amount of heat to create power. Keep reactor power low to use it separate from the engine
-- Engine heat production cut by factor of 10
-- Only applies to KerbalAtomics engines and the LV-N at the moment

0.1.1
-----
- Updated bundled CRP to 0.4.9.0
- Fixed ISRU patch not affecting the mini ISRU
- Fixed tech locations for nuclear rockets
- Increased Neptune thrust to 67 from 62.5
- When converted to LH2, most NTRs now benefit from a mass reduction
- Reduced boiloff cooling cost to 0.08 Ec/1000u from 0.1 Ec/1000u
- Added new Extras patch converting engines to LF-only. LF-only engines have reduced Isp and TWRs, comparable to those from Atomic Age and Stock

0.1.0
------
- Initial release
