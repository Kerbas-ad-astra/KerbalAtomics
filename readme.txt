======================
KERBAL ATOMICS v0.4.11
======================

This pack aims to add more options to nuclear thermal propulsion systems in KSP. It adds several engines and modifies the stock (and most mod) nuclear engine to run on Liquid Hydrogen.
Liquid Hydrogen is a messy fuel that leaks out of most tanks (slowly) and takes up a lot of space, but gives the highest possible specific impulse. Included are patches that allow all stock fuel tanks to contain the appropriate resources, and a set of new specialized LiquidHydrogen tanks that are insulated to stop leakage.


============
DEPENDENCIES
============

Required:
- B9PartSwitch (2.1.0)
- Community Resource Pack (0.8.0)
- ModuleManager (3.0.1)
- Deployable Engines (1.1.0)
- DynamicBatteryStorage (1.2.0)

Optional
- Community Tech Tree (v3.0+)

============
INSTALLATION
============

I recommend removing any previous versions of Kerbal Atomics before installing an update.

To install, place the GameData folder inside your Kerbal Space Program folder. If asked to overwrite files, do so.

I recommend the use of the Community Tech Tree (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/100385-Community-Tech-Tree-1-0), which will place engines in various high tech nodes.

======================
INSTALLATION OF EXTRAS
======================

Some extra patches are bundled that you can use to tweak your installation. To install them, drop the correct folder from the Extras folder in this archive into your KSP GameData Folder

NTRsUseLF: Reverts all NTRs to using Liquid Fuel
NearFutureElectricalNTRs: Advanced NTR management when coupled with Near Future Electrical (EXPERIMENTAL)

============

This mod includes version checking using MiniAVC (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79745).
If you opt-in, it will use the internet to check whether there is a new version available. Data is only read from the internet and no personal information is sent.
For a more comprehensive version checking experience, please download the KSP-AVC Plugin (http://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/threads/79745).
